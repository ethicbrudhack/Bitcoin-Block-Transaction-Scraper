# Bitcoin-Block-Transaction-Scraper
This Python script automatically fetches Bitcoin transaction IDs (txids) from public blockchain explorer APIs, starting from a specific block height and continuing up to a defined end block. It’s designed for reliable, long-term data collection — it automatically switches APIs if one fails or gets rate-limited.
